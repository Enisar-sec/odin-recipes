        <li> Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a small pan or skillet. </li>
        <li>Place mushrooms in a single layer in the skillet, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Top with onions, then peppers, and another pinch of salt. </li>
        <li>Place on medium high heat, and wait for mushrooms to start sizzling. Cook until bottoms of mushrooms are nicely browned, about 3 minutes, and then stir everything together and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
